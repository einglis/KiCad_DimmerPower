# Dimmer Power Board

A power board for my lounge dimmer project.  Ultimately driven by an Arduino running code in https://github.com/einglis/dimmer.  (And a RaspberyPI providing a UI, and another Arduino receiving Rako wireless commands, both also running code from the same repo.)

Originally based on https://www.instructables.com/Multichannel-Wireless-Light-Dimmer/

At the time of writing, the six live boards have got 5 years of successful operation under their belts.

## Version History
I drew this originally in Eagle, but the committed project is for KiCad.  KiCad seemed to import it just fine and the schematic and board layout look identical to the production parts; the gerbers in the `output/` folder check out too.

All the same, I preserved the bulk of the Eagle files in the `retired/` folder, just in case.  They show signs of sequential-numbering version control...
